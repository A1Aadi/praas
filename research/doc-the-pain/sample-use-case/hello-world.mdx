Hello, I am so and so and I write about such and such.

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.<sup>[1](#1)</sup>

## Let's get started
This week I found a couple of cool things... for example this page you are reading was generated like so:

```console
> mkdir public
> x0 build sample-use-case/hello-world.mdx -d ./public -s
```

How cool is that? I also learn't a few things about forms and the DOM API. You can read more about it [here](https://medium.com/@everdimension/how-to-handle-forms-with-just-react-ac066c48bd4f)

I don't have a cadence but I do like to spread the love on things I find interesting and useful. If that interests you you can sign up to be notified.
